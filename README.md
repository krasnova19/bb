# mixin

The Mixin BFT-DAG network reference implementation, the Trusted Execution Environment is not integrated into this repository yet.

## Get Started

Install golang and setup `GOPATH` following this guide https://golang.org/doc/install.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MixinNetwork/mixin.git
$ cd mixin
$ go build
```

The `mixin` command is both the kernel node and tools to communicate with the node RPC interface.

```

## Mixin Kernel Address

Mixin Kernel address are a pair of ed25519 keys, following the [CryptoNote](https://cryptonote.org/standards/) protocol. To create a new address use the `createaddress` command.

```
$ mixin createaddress

address:	XINJkpCdwVk3qFqmS3AAAoTmC5Gm2fR3iRF7Rtt7hayuaLXNrtztS3LGPSxTmq5KQh3KJ2qYXYE5a9w8BWXhZAdsJKXqcvUr
view key:	568302b687a2fa3e8853ff35d99ffdf3817b98170de7b51e43d0dcf4fe30470f
spend key:	7c2b5c97278ed371d75610cccd9681af31b0d99be4adc2d66983f3c455fc9702
```

Share the `address` to receive assets from other Mixin Kernel addresses, and keep `view key` and `spend key` privately and securely.

Both the `view key` and `spend key` are required to spend the assets received from others, and the `view key` iteself is sufficient to decode and view all the transactions sent to `address`.


## Sign and Send Raw Transaction

Basic Mixin Kernel transaction is similar to the transaction in Bitcoin, with following format.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "asset": "a99c2e0e2b1da4d648755ef19bd95139acbbe6564cfb06dec7cd34931ca72cdc",
  "extra": "34366362393932382d653636632d343966392d386165632d366462366137346666663638",
  "outputs": [
    {
      "type": 0,
      "amount": "115.06849309",
      "script": "fffe01",
      "accounts": [
        "XINPXu5NBXszhpZDRJ8iA26TbQ2oWTSq1tXqKKeVeYWgLSz8yXGTtVhMogynYytoMewYVFR541wauLhy1YV33zg445E49YA7"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "inputs": [
    {
      "hash": "20001842d6eff5129c11f7c053bf1209f0267bf223f1681c9cb9d19fc773a692",
      "index": 11
    }
  ]
}
```

This is the same UTXO model used in Bitcoin, but with different field names. Among them `version`, `type` and `script` should not be modified unless you know some advanced topics.

Compact the raw transaction JSON and sign it with the private view and spend key as following.

```
$ mixin signrawtransaction -n mixin-node:8239 \
    -key 0d48c96d383d325a97eea5295cbf3afa7766c49db477b68fd8032ff7f59b0b00d77e434f96f3f42c2d1796662c7cc90497feaf3863a5815f27ba49fd5e29b906 \
    -raw '{"version":1,"asset":"a99c2e0e2b1da4d648755ef19bd95139acbbe6564cfb06dec7cd34931ca72cdc","extra":"34366362393932382d653636632d343966392d386165632d366462366137346666663638","outputs":[{"type":0,"amount":"115.06849309","script":"fffe01","accounts":["XINPXu5NBXszhpZDRJ8iA26TbQ2oWTSq1tXqKKeVeYWgLSz8yXGTtVhMogynYytoMewYVFR541wauLhy1YV33zg445E49YA7"]}],"inputs":[{"hash":"20001842d6eff5129c11f7c053bf1209f0267bf223f1681c9cb9d19fc773a692","index":11}]}'
```


## Start a Kernel Node

To start a node, create a directory `mixin` for the config and network data files, then put the genesis.json, nodes.json and config.json files in it.

The main net genesis.json, nodes.json and an example config.example.json files can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/mixin/tree/master/config), you only need to put your own signer spend key in the config.json file.

```
$ mixin help kernel

NAME:
   mixin kernel - Start the Mixin Kernel daemon

USAGE:
   mixin kernel [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --dir value, -d value   the data directory
   --port value, -p value  the peer port to listen (default: 7239)
```

## Local Test Net

This will setup a minimum local test net, with all nodes in a single device.

```
$ mixin setuptestnet

$ mixin kernel -dir /tmp/mixin-7001 -port 7001
$ mixin kernel -dir /tmp/mixin-7002 -port 7002
$ mixin kernel -dir /tmp/mixin-7003 -port 7003
$ mixin kernel -dir /tmp/mixin-7004 -port 7004
$ mixin kernel -dir /tmp/mixin-7005 -port 7005
$ mixin kernel -dir /tmp/mixin-7006 -port 7006
$ mixin kernel -dir /tmp/mixin-7007 -port 7007
```
